FlashPoint is a lightweight news reader built with React and Vite. Browse the latest headlines by category, search across articles, and enjoy a clean, responsive UI.

> Note: This app uses the public NewsAPI.org service and requires an API key.

## Features 🌟

- Category filters: Technology, Business, Health, Sports, Entertainment
- Keyword search: Toggle a search bar and query across articles
- Image fallback: Broken images automatically fall back to a default
- Responsive UI: Built with Bootstrap 5
- Simple auth modals: In‑memory Sign In/Sign Up for demo purposes (no backend)

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- React 18 + Vite 5
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Font Awesome React for icons
- NewsAPI.org for data

## Prerequisites 

- Node.js 18+ (required by Vite 5)

## How to Use 🤔

1) Clone the repository

```cmd
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd FlashPoint
```

2) Install dependencies

```cmd
npm install
```

3) Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root and set your NewsAPI key:

```
VITE_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
```

4) Start the dev server

```cmd
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL printed in the terminal.

## Available Scripts 📄

- `npm run dev` — Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint

## How It Works 🤔

- Headlines endpoint: When you select a category, the app calls `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=<category>&apiKey=<key>`
- Search endpoint: When you submit a search, the app calls `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=<query>&apiKey=<key>`
- API key is read from `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` (set in `.env`)
- Articles without an image are filtered out; broken images fall back to a local placeholder
- Sign In/Sign Up are purely client‑side and stored in memory for demo only

└─ package.json
```

## Configuration Notes 📄

- Put your NewsAPI key in `.env` as `VITE_API_KEY`. Do not commit your real key.
- The current UI uses Bootstrap via CDN. If you prefer package-managed CSS, add `bootstrap` to dependencies and import its CSS in `main.jsx`.
- Auth modals are for UI only; there is no persistence or server.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- 401 Unauthorized from NewsAPI: Verify `VITE_API_KEY` is set in `.env` and you restarted the dev server.
- Empty results: Categories are US‑centric by default (`country=us`). Try Search mode for broader results.
- Mixed content/CORS issues on custom deployments: Serve over HTTPS and ensure your host allows outbound requests to NewsAPI.
